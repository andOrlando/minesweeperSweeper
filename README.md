solves GamesROB's minesweeper because I can't beat it without a robot myself
 
Are you fed up with GamesROB's minesweeper? So am I. If you have this bot and you show your frustration, it'll do everything for you. All you have to do is type this simple line:

`GamesROB's minesweeper sucks`

and just do whatever the bot tells you to do.\ If you want it to go back to normal, type

`nvm its not actually that bad`

That being said, minesweeper is inherently chance based so there's a decent chance you still fail and it'll calculate those probabilities as best it can.
